        <p>Used to dream of being a millionaire, without a care. But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there 'Cause it's over That just wont be fair Darling Rather be a poor woman living on the street No food to eat 'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry 'Cause it's over When you said goodbye! All at once I had it all But it doesn't mean anything Now that you're gone From afar, seems I had it all But it doesn't mean anything Since you're gone. Now I see myself through different eyes It's no surprise! Being alone will make you realize When it's over! All in love is fair I shoulda been there I shoulda been there, I shoulda shoulda. All at once I had it all But It doesn't mean anythingNow that you're goneFrom afar, seems I had it all But it doesn't mean anything Since you're gone I know I pushed you away What can I do that would save our love Take these material things They don't mean nothing It's you that I want All at once I had it all But it doesn't mean anything Now that you're gone From afar Seems I had it all But it doesn't mean anything Since you're gone I shoulda been there I shoulda been there, I shoulda, I shoulda All at once I had it all But it doesn't mean anything Now that you're gone From afar, Seems I had it all But it doesn't mean anything Since you're gone.</p>
